Again i wanted to make a better script for movemnt then the first move script i made. I wanted this one to go with the frist person view 


I found a really helpful tutorial that helped me making a good movement script. One that really worked well combined with the looking script. 
I think when combined with the looking scrpit works really well and i think i will use them for my game.
