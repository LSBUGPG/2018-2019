This script i wanted to make a hud which could go along with my flashlight for my game. Using the other scripts like the pick up , move and looking scpits. 
so the hud can tell the player how many batterys they have and have a meter telling tha player how much battery they have left in flashlight from 100.
The meter weill drain as the player useses the flashlight. 


I had touble finding a good tutorial on how to make this work in unity. After long time i found a really useful one which worked for me. 

I found this one to be very challanging but after i found how to make this work in the my scirpt worked perfectly. 

I am very happy at the end result and works really well with the flashlight in the game.
