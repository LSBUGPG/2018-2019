How to be build a working flashlight tutorial hud 

This tutorial will show how to build a working flashlight hud. From picking up batterys and having a hud showing them draning and how many batterys the player has. 

## 1. create a new scene (make a floor with a object) 

## 2. create a create an empty gameobject rename it to player and add component character controller.

## 3. Then add a camara to the player by right clicking on player and renaming it Playercamera

## 4. add playermove and playerlook scrpts to the player and camera. 

## 5 use the assets with a flashlight and batterys placing them in the sence adding box colliers to both and triggering both 

## 6. First we should set up the Hud. Make a scrpit and call it HUD - this will show that the battery count is and how many batterys the player has. 

public class HUD : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static int BatteryCount;
    public static bool HasFlashlight;

    void OnGUI()
    {
        if (HasFlashlight)
        {
            GUI.Label(new Rect(10, 10, 80, 30), "Flashlight");
            GUI.Label(new Rect(70, 10, 80, 30), Flashlight.BatteryLife.ToString("F2"));
        }
        GUI.Label(new Rect(10, 40, 80, 30), "Batteries");
        GUI.Label(new Rect(70, 40, 80, 30), BatteryCount.ToString());
    }
}

Once having saved this to the script go back to unity and attach the scipt to the floor of the scene - run the game and battery - 0 should appear in the top left of the screen. 

## 7. The next step is setting up the pick up scrpit - this script will be put on the battery and the flashlight  


public class PickUp : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject children;
    public enum Item
    {
        Flashlight,
        Battery
    }
    public Item item;
    void OnTriggerEnter()
    {
        if (item == Item.Flashlight)
        {

            

            HUD.HasFlashlight = true;
        }
        else
            HUD.BatteryCount++;

        Destroy(gameObject);
    }
}

in unity now looking at the inspector making sure the script item says the battery is set to battery and the flash light is set to flashlight 


## 8.  The next step is to make a script for the flashlight and to asign a key for it to work. Here i made the ket E.



public class Flashlight : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static float BatteryLife = 100;
    public static GameObject HeadlightMount;
    public Light HeadLight;
    public float BatteryReductionSpeed = 3.0f;

    void Awake()
    {

        HeadlightMount = GameObject.FindWithTag("Headlamp");

        HeadlightMount.SetActive(false);

        HeadLight.enabled = false;
    }
    void Update()
    {
        if (HeadLight.enabled)
        {
            BatteryLife = BatteryLife - (BatteryReductionSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
        }
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.E) && HUD.HasFlashlight && !HeadLight.enabled && HUD.BatteryCount > 0)
        {
            if (BatteryLife <= 0 && HUD.BatteryCount > 0)
            {
                HUD.BatteryCount--;
                BatteryLife = 100;
            }
            HeadLight.enabled = true;
        }
        else if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.E) && HUD.HasFlashlight && HeadLight.enabled)
        {
            HeadLight.enabled = false;
        }
        if (BatteryLife <= 0)
        {
            BatteryLife = 0;
            HeadLight.enabled = false;
        }
    }
}

## 9. Go back to unity and Make a  Gameobject and place it on the player in the middle and call it HeadLampMount. Add a flashlight to the headlampmout and make it children with it. 

## 10. Go to tag and make a tag called Headlamp and tag it to HeadlampMount. 


## 11. Now pressing play in the sence the player will be able to pick up the the flashlight and the battery as the player does this pressing E will turn the flashlight on and off draining the battery.
