Respawning and "Death" behaviour tutorial

Run the "RespawnDeath" scene and use W, A, S, D to move around. Upon walking into a red-coloured cube, you will find that the camera (along with the player) will be destroyed. Should you
collide with a purple-coloured cube, you will respawn back to a set position.
