When making the code I looked up a video on colour changing in unity with scripts and clicked on the first video that had some audio attacted to it.
Unfortunately it was not up to date and only worked for an earleir version of Unity so I asked for Pauls assitstance and we modified it. I would like
to reference the video that I watched for the tutroial but it has somehow dissapeared from the internet as a whole and no longer exists.
