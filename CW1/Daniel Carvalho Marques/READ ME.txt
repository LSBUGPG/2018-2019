IMPORTANT - extract the files from the zip before running the programming component. Do not try to run the game without extracting first.



The programming component only requires the arrow keys to be played, with each arrow corresponding to a side of the screen.
In the behaviour tutorial I had the cubes being spawned manually with button presses, but for this I have made a game master script which spawns the cubes automaticaly.

Inside the scripts folder there is a scene02 folder (which has the most recent scripts) and some scripts outside the scene02 folder (which are old scripts).
Sample scene is a default unity scene - ignore.
Scene 01 is a test scene - ignore.
Scene 02 is the scene which has the component to be played.
