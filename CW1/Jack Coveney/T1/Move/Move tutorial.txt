# Move tutorial

This shows how to create a character controller.

## 1. Create a new scene. 


## 2. Go to gameobject then 3d object and selected a cube. Then do that again and instead selected a plane and scale it up. 

Make the cube sit on top of the plane. 

## 3. Click on the cube and add a component, go to physics rigid body. 

next is to add a script. Again add a component select script(C#) and name it Move. 

## 4. Once opened delete at the top -

// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {


and put 

  public float speed = 10.0f;
    public float rotationSpeed = 100.0f;

## 5 Then under void add 

 float translation = Input.GetAxis ("Vertical") * speed;
        float rotation = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * rotationSpeed;
        translation *= Time.deltaTime;
        rotation *= Time.deltaTime;
        transform.Translate(0, 0, translation);
        transform.Rotate(0, rotation, 0);
	}
}

	
## 5. Now switch back to the Unity and W and S is to move, A and D is to turn around.
